                <p class="header-subtitle1-about">I've been called a 'pragmatic' designer.<br>I take that as a
                    compliment.</p>
                <p class="header-subtitle1-about">My professional work slants towards product design that can
                    make a measurable impact.
                    Usability over style. Stylish when called for.</p>
                <p class="header-subtitle1-about">Learning from your customers and shipping delightful, yet
                    useful tools for them is both
                    rewarding and challenging, which is why I've been drawn to working with early products,
                    especially those where you can get to know your users personally.</p>
                <p class="header-subtitle1-about">I've had the privilege of working with some great teams on
                    some truly impactful products, and
                    have learned a thing or two along the way. I bring that experience to new ventures and try
                    to share it with folks through mentoring and <a href="#">writing</a>.</p>
                <p class="header-subtitle1-about">I tend to think about design like a founder, because I've been
                    one. Balancing process and
                    instinct, the goal is to find harmony between user delight and business strategy, as fast as
                    you can deliver quality.</p>
                <p class="header-subtitle1-about">If this seems like your cup of tea, I'd be pleased to chat
                    about your project needs. My
